# FitMod

With an increase in health issues over the recent years, the general population is much more informed about health risks and performs regular health checkups. However, a common problem that was noticed was how they did not have any provision to store all their test report data at a single location. Thus, a prototype GUI application, called FitMod, has been developed, so as to collect and generate instant health reports, analyse health parameters, consolidate all data entered and store it for future retrieval and also to assess a userâ€™s health in the long run.
